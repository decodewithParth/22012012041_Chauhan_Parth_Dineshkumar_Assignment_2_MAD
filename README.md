Project Title: Android Quiz App

Project Description:
The Android Quiz App is a user-friendly mobile application developed in Kotlin, designed to provide an engaging and interactive quiz experience. This app begins by prompting the user to input their first name, creating a personalized touch to the quiz. Once the user has entered their name, they are presented with a series of 10 thought-provoking questions covering a range of topics.

The app displays each question one at a time, allowing the user to select their answer from multiple-choice options. After answering all 10 questions, the app calculates the user's score based on their correct responses and generates a results screen.

The results screen displays the user's name alongside their total score, providing instant feedback on their performance. Users can also share their scores with friends and family through various social media platforms. The Android Quiz App offers an engaging and educational experience, making it an ideal choice for those looking to test their knowledge and have fun while doing so.
